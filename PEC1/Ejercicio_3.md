Obtenga un contrato inteligente que haya utilizado anteriormente o desarrolle uno tan
simple como pueda.
A partir del compilador de Solidity y habilitando siempre la optimización. Obtenga:
- Códigos de operación del contrato inteligente.
- Identificadores de las funciones que existan dentro del contrato inteligente.
- Estimación del gas utilizado por cada función



A partir del siguiente ficherp y haciendo uso del compilador de solidity.

    Pragma solidity ^0.4.11;


    contract multiplica {

    uint256 T;
    uint256 P;
    uint256 R;
    constructor () public {
        T = 10;
        P = 5;
    }
    
    function producto() public{
        R = T*P;
    }
    
    function multiplicacion() public{
        R = R*2;
    }
}

1. En primer lugar instalamos el compilador

    $sudo npm install -g solc 

2.En segundo lugar generamos el archivo binario y realizamos su depuración a través del compilador de EVM.

El resultado en consola nos indica cada operación y su respectivo consumo de gas:
